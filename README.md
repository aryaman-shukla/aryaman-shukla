## About me

By day, I'm a B.Tech. student, delving into the fascinating world of AI and Machine Learning. By night, the code transforms into pixels and algorithms into puzzles, as I channel my passion into game development and data science. My days are fueled by the thrill of discovery, while my nights are illuminated by the joy of creation. This website is a window into my dual lives, where academic pursuits merge with personal projects, and lines blur between learning and building. Welcome to my journey across the frontiers of technology, where curiosity is the compass and innovation the destination.
